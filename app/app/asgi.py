# This is mainly used for deployment if you are deploying via ASGI.
# Django supports deploying on ASGI(Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)
# Djangoâ€™s startproject management command sets up a default ASGI configuration for you,
# which you can tweak as needed for your project, and direct any ASGI-compliant application server to use.
# It is used as an interface between application server to
# connect with django or any python framework which implements ASGI
