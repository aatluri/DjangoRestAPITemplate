# Django supports deploying on WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface).
# Djangoâ€™s startproject management command sets up a default WSGI configuration for you,
# which you can tweak as needed for your project, and direct any WSGI-compliant application server to use.
# It is used as an interface between application server to
# connect with django or any python framework which implements wsgi
